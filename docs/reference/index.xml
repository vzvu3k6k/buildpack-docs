      <description>This specification defines the interface between a buildpack and the environment that runs it. This API will be used by buildpack authors.
A buildpack must contain three files:
 buildpack.toml bin/detect bin/build  The two files in bin/ must be executable. They can be shell scripts written in a language like Bash or they can be executables compiled from a language like Go.
bin/detect Usage bin/detect PLATFORM_DIR BUILD_PLAN  Summary This entrypoint is used to determine if a buildpack should run against a given codebase.</description>

      <description>This specification defines the interface between the buildpack execution environment, referred to as the lifecycle, and a platform that supports it. This API is used by platform implementors.
Stacks A stack defines two OCI images: a build image and a run image. The build image is used to run the buildpack lifecycle, and the run image is the base image the final exported image will be built upon.
For more information see Working with stacks.</description>
